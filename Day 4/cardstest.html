                            <b>Translation:</b> Crispy fried dough topped with chickpeas, potatoes, yogurt, chutneys, and spices<br/><br/>

This is a popular street food from northern India that's a great option for a starter. "Chaat" is the overall term for savory street food often found on Indian roadside carts, and "papdi" refers to the crunchy dough bits that make up the base.

                            <b>Translation:</b> Stuffed fried pastry dough<br/><br/>

Any meal where you're able to secure a dish of fried, stuffed dough pockets is bound to be a good one. The shape and preparation varies based on their location of origin, and while some types have meat, others are suitable for vegetarians.

                            <b>Translation:</b> Thick, leavened flatbread<br/><br/>

Picture the shape of pita, but with a fluffier texture, thanks to the addition of eggs and yogurt to the dough. There are also many varieties of naan, like rounds topped with garlic or filled with tandoori chicken.

                            <b>Translation:</b> Layered, unleavened flatbread<br/><br/>  No table is complete without multiple types of bread, as far as we're concerned. There's a wonderfully staggering number of types of Indian bread, and while this is one that's often served with breakfast, it's delicious no matter the hour.

                            Dosas first came from south India, and are thin pancakes of fermented rice batter that. They can be eaten on their own, served with chutney, or stuffed with spiced potatoes.

                            For those who gravitate to spicy Indian dishes, don't even think about forgoing an order of raita. The cooling effect is a highly welcome reprieve between bites of peppery main dishes. But no matter what you end up ordering, it's delightful in its own right when used as a dip with naan.

                            Lentils are tiny legumes with big importance, as they're among the staple ingredients found in Indian cuisine. Depending where you order dal, you might be served a thinner soup-like bowl of lentils, or something more akin to a stew that comes with a side of rice. Additionally, it could be made with red lentils, yellow split peas, black lentils, or more.

                            <b>Translation:</b> Spiced black tea with milk<br/><br/>  Masala chai (meaning "spiced tea") can be traced back thousands of years. The specific spices involved will depend on where you get it, but you can usually expect a blend of black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger. If you're somewhere that offers a homemade in-house blend, you'll definitely want to give it a try. One key thing to note: saying "chai tea" is redundant, it translates to "tea tea."
